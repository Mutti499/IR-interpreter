# IR-interpreter

## Introduction
  Welcome to a brandly new C programming project. In this project, I developed a transpiler that translates input in the form of assignment statements and expressions of the AdvCalc++ language into LLVM IR
code that can compute and output those statements.
A transpiler, also known as a source-to-source compiler, is a type of compiler that translates source code
from one programming language to another. In this case, our program will translate the input code into
LLVM IR code, which is a low-level intermediate representation that can be used to generate code for various
target architectures

This project is the enchanced version of "https://github.com/Mutti499/c-interpreter"
